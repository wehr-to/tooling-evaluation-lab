# üîß Tooling Evaluation Lab

A structured repo for evaluating, comparing, and documenting security tooling tradeoffs. This lab tests open-source and commercial options head-to-head, helping practitioners think critically about what to deploy and why.

## üéØ Why This Repo Exists

Security teams often adopt tools based on hype or vendor demos. This lab promotes:
- Real-world **side-by-side evaluation** of competing tools
- Documentation of **strengths, gaps, and caveats**
- Skill-building in **defending tooling choices**
- A launchpad for advisory and security architecture roles

## üìÇ Folder Structure

| Folder               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `edr-eval/`          | e.g. Wazuh vs OSQuery: Host telemetry, integrity monitoring |
| `ids-eval/`          | e.g. Suricata vs Zeek: Network visibility and detection |
| `iac-scanning/`      | e.g. tfsec vs Checkov: IaC security scanning and policy enforcement |
| `methodology/`       | Evaluation criteria, rubric templates, and process writeups |
| `results/`           | Findings from lab environments with pros/cons listed |
| `docs/`              | Background, setup, tuning notes, and conclusions |

## üß™ Evaluation Axes
- **Detection coverage**
- **Noise vs fidelity**
- **Ease of deployment and config**
- **Community and documentation quality**
- **Extensibility and integrations**

## üö® Signal
This repo shows you:
- **Think critically** about tools, not just use them
- Understand tradeoffs and **deployment context**
- Are capable of **advisory, architect, or evaluation roles**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder
All tools should be evaluated in isolated, safe environments. Never introduce unknown software into production without proper testing.
